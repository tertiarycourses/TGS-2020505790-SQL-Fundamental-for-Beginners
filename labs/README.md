# SQL Fundamental for Beginners — Hands-On Labs

**WSQ Course Code:** TGS-2020505790 · **Version v14** · Tertiary Infotech Academy Pte Ltd

Full step-by-step for every lab is also in the Learner Guide (LG). Labs run in SQLite Studio (https://sqlitestudio.pl) or https://sqliteonline.com.

## How the labs are organised

**Each lab is one folder holding everything that lab needs** — the instructions, the mock data as CSV, and the SQL seed scripts side by side:

```
lab-07-aggregate-data-with-count-avg-and-sum/
├── lab-07-aggregate-data-with-count-avg-and-sum.md   the step-by-step
├── Orders.csv  OrderItems.csv  Products.csv          the data (opens in Excel)
├── seed_sqlite.sql                                   create + fill, SQLite
└── seed_mysql.sql                                    the same for MySQL / SQL Server
```

Open the folder for the lab you are on, run `seed_sqlite.sql` in the SQL editor, and follow the `.md`.

The running example is **SG Mart Pte Ltd**, a fictitious Singapore retail chain (8 outlets, 42 staff, 60 members, 25 products, 180 orders, 685 order lines). Topic 4 switches to an **SMRT** transport model for the data-warehouse case study. All data is invented for training and identifies no real person or company.

The complete dataset — every table as CSV, an Excel workbook and a prebuilt `sgmart.db` — is in [`_all/`](_all/). The original sample databases from earlier versions of this course (`world.db`, `album.db`, `test.db` and their .sql scripts) are kept in [`legacy-datasets/`](legacy-datasets/).
