# Mock Datasets — SQL Fundamental for Beginners

**TGS-2020505790** · v14 · Tertiary Infotech Academy Pte Ltd

This folder holds the **complete** course dataset: every table as CSV, an Excel workbook and a prebuilt `sgmart.db`. Each individual lab also carries just the tables it needs, in that lab's own folder beside its instructions.

## The business story

**SG Mart Pte Ltd** is a fictitious Singapore retail chain with 8 outlets. You will model its outlets, staff, customers, suppliers, products, orders and order lines. Topic 4 switches to an **SMRT** public-transport model (routes, stations, timetables and service disruptions) for the data-warehouse case study.

> All data is invented for training. Names, phone numbers, emails and badge numbers do not identify any real person or organisation.

| `OrderItems` | 685 | Order lines (the fact table) — quantity, unit price, discount and line total. Makes SUM/AVG/GROUP BY meaningful. |
| `Routes` | 8 | 8 SMRT routes (6 MRT lines + 2 bus services) — the parent entity of the transport E-R model. |

| `DisruptedRoutes` | 6 | 6 service disruptions in 2025 — type, details, start time, duration and the alternative arrangements offered. |
| `Persons` | 8 | Small Persons table for constraint practice (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK Age >= 18, DEFAULT City). |
| `PersonOrders` | 8 | Child table for the Persons FK demo — some rows point at persons who exist, one is deliberately unmatched. |
| `left_t` | 4 | Practice table for the FULL OUTER JOIN emulation (ids 1-4). |
| `right_t` | 4 | Practice table for the FULL OUTER JOIN emulation (ids 3-6). |
